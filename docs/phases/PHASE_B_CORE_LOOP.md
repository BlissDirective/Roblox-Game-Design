# PHASE B — Core Loop

> Per-sub-phase worklog. Updated by Claude Code at the end of each
> sub-phase per `10_BUILD_PROTOCOL.md` (Plan → Confirm → Build → Verify
> → Commit → Report).

**Goal (per `finalized-brainstorm.md` §4.3):** A player can land on a
planet, scout for nodes, place an extractor, watch credits accrue, and
build their first wall.

**Phase audit gate:** Two-client Studio playtest. Both players scout,
place extractors, watch Credits accrue. Both players rejoin and base
state + Credits persist. Camera swap (TP↔FP) feels smooth.

---

## Phase research pass (run at kickoff)

Four parallel searches recorded findings:
- **Server Authority Studio Beta (2026, new).** Adopted for V1 per
  ADR-005 (supersedes ADR-004 same-day on user reframe).
- **StreamingEnabled** is tycoon-friendly with a footgun: bulk destroys
  cause ping spikes. Mitigation in `Constants.STREAMING`
  (BulkDestroyBatchSize / Delay) — Phase E plot-reset code honors it.
- **Poisson disk sampling** — Bridson's algorithm; community examples
  validate the seeded-deterministic approach we use in B1.
- **Camera TP↔FP via TweenService** — standard. Mobile-safe at 60Hz.

---

## B1 — World scaffold + resource node spawner + placement Remote ✅

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Branch:** `claude/review-claude-docs-LiZZS`

### Architectural decisions (logged before code)

- **ADR-004** — Defer Server Authority Beta to V1.5/V2. *Superseded
  same-day by ADR-005.*
- **ADR-005** — Adopt Server Authority Beta for V1. User reframed the
  cost: foundational changes are cheaper at A/B than V1.5 retrofit.
  Reversibility is real (rolling back is a project-file revert).

### What was built

- **`default.project.json`** — Workspace properties added:
  `StreamingEnabled = true`, `StreamingMinRadius = 256`,
  `StreamingTargetRadius = 512`. The Server-Authority-Beta-only
  properties (`AuthorityMode`, `NextGenerationReplication`,
  `UseFixedSimulation`, `PlayerScriptsUseInput`, `SignalBehavior`)
  aren't in Rojo's reflection database yet, so they're applied at
  runtime by `ServerAuthorityBootstrap` (below). Discovered when
  `rojo build` rejected `Workspace.UseFixedSimulation` as
  "Unresolvable property".
- **`src/server/Modules/Lifecycle/ServerAuthorityBootstrap.luau`** —
  applies the five SA Beta Workspace properties at server boot. Each
  set is `pcall`-wrapped: if the runtime doesn't recognize a property
  (Beta disabled in Studio, or property renamed), the bootstrap skips
  it and logs which ones didn't take. This is the single chokepoint
  for SA Beta enablement; rollback per ADR-005 is "comment out the
  Apply() call".
- **`docs/playbooks/DAILY_DEV_LOOP.md`** — added the one-time-setup
  step for enabling **Beta Features → Server Authority Core API** in
  Studio. Without it, the new Workspace properties don't apply
  correctly.
- **`Constants.luau`** — added `WORLD` (plot grid layout), `NODES`
  (Poisson disk params), `BUILD` (placement validation), `STREAMING`
  (radii + bulk-destroy throttle). `FEATURES.debugModeToggle` flag
  added for B5's testing keybind.
- **`src/shared/Modules/Math/PoissonDisk.luau`** — Bridson's algorithm,
  cell-grid accelerated. Seeded `Random.new(seed)`. Deterministic.
- **`src/shared/Modules/Math/GridMath.luau`** — `SnapToCell`,
  `CellToWorld`, `SnapVector`, `IsInsidePlot`, `CellKey` helpers used
  by both server (PlacementService) and client (B4 preview).
- **`src/server/Modules/World/PlotManager.luau`** — builds a 2×2 grid
  of 64×64 plots (plus 32-stud gaps), allocates one plot per player
  on join, releases on leave. Idempotent (handles Studio script
  reload). Tints each plot floor differently for visual debugging.
- **`src/server/Modules/World/ResourceNodeSpawner.luau`** — per-plot
  Poisson disk distribution of resource nodes. Seed derived from
  `game.JobId` (or `os.time()` in Studio sessions). Snaps node
  positions to the placement grid so a node-cell maps 1:1 to a
  placement-cell.
- **`src/server/Modules/Build/BuildableRegistry.luau`** — catalog of
  two starter buildables: extractor (requires node, 1 Credit/sec
  income, 50 Credits cost) and wall (free placement, 20 Credits
  cost). Builds visual Parts directly — Phase G replaces with real
  models.
- **`src/server/Modules/Build/PlacementService.luau`** — single
  chokepoint for placement requests. Validates: plot allocation,
  buildable id, cell bounds, cell occupancy, node requirement.
  Affordability (B2) and reach raycast (F1) deferred. Wires the
  `PlaceBuilding` Remote.
- **`src/shared/Remotes.luau`** — first registration:
  `PlaceBuilding = getOrCreate("PlaceBuilding", "RemoteEvent")`.
  Removed the `selene: allow(unused_variable)` directive on
  `getOrCreate` since it has a caller now.
- **`src/server/init.server.luau`** — wired Init() chain in order:
  DataManager → PlotManager → ResourceNodeSpawner → PlacementService.
- **`docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md`** — ADR-004 + ADR-005 logged.
- **`docs/architecture/REMOTES_REGISTRY.md`** — `PlaceBuilding` row
  added.

### Audit (B1-scope, sandbox-side)

- All `.luau` files start with `--!strict`
- Tab-indented per `stylua.toml`
- `default.project.json` valid JSON (manual inspection — Workspace
  Beta property names per Roblox 2026 docs; CI's `rojo build` will
  flag any property-name drift)
- All require paths resolve through Rojo's tree mapping
- BuildableRegistry catalog vs `BUILD.ExtractorRequiresNode` cross-check

### Audit (B1-scope, Studio-side — pending your local run)

After `rojo serve` + Studio Connect (with Beta Features → Server
Authority Core API enabled — see DAILY_DEV_LOOP.md):
1. Press F5. Output should include, in this order:
   ```
   [ServerAuthorityBootstrap] Applied 5/5 SA Beta Workspace properties.
   [DataManager] Loaded <YourName> — session #N, ...
   [PlotManager] Built 4 plots (64x64 studs each)
   [PlotManager] Allocated Plot1 to <YourName>
   [ResourceNodeSpawner] Plot1: ~10 nodes (seed=<int>)
   [ResourceNodeSpawner] Plot2: ~10 nodes (seed=<int>)
   ...
   [Outpost-7] Server bootstrap complete. ... plots=4
   ```
   If `[ServerAuthorityBootstrap] Applied N/5` shows fewer than 5,
   the named skipped properties either need the Studio Beta enabled
   or have been renamed in a Roblox release. Log the names in
   `DECISIONS.md` and update `ServerAuthorityBootstrap.luau`.
2. World shows 4 colored plot floors in a 2×2 grid centered on origin.
   Each plot has ~10 emissive teal node spheres scattered across it.
3. **Command Bar (Server context) — placement smoke test:**
   ```luau
   local PlacementService = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Build.PlacementService)
   local PlotManager = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.World.PlotManager)
   local player = game.Players:GetPlayers()[1]
   local plot = PlotManager.GetPlot(player)
   local firstNode = plot.nodes:GetChildren()[1]
   local cellX = firstNode:GetAttribute("CellX")
   local cellZ = firstNode:GetAttribute("CellZ")
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(player, "extractor", cellX, cellZ))
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(player, "extractor", cellX, cellZ)) -- expect "node already claimed"
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(player, "wall", cellX + 2, cellZ))   -- expect ok
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(player, "wall", 9999, 9999))          -- expect "cell outside plot"
   ```
4. Visual: extractor and wall Parts appear on the plot at the expected
   cells. Node where extractor was placed has `Claimed = true`
   attribute.

### Tech debt / deferred

- **No client UI for placement** — B4 wires the build palette + ghost
  preview. Until then, audit is via Command Bar. **B1 audit must run
  before B2 starts** to confirm placement works end-to-end.
- **Affordability check is a no-op** at B1. B2 wires
  `CurrencyService.TrySpend` into the validation chain.
- **Reach raycast is a no-op** at B1. F1 hardens with server-side
  raycast from character position to placement target.
- **Persistent base state** (saving placements to DataStore) is B3.
  Currently every server restart wipes all placements.
- **`PlacementResult` Remote** for UI feedback is not registered. B4
  decides whether to add it or convert `PlaceBuilding` to a
  `RemoteFunction`.
- **Plot character spawning** — players spawn at the world default
  origin, not their plot. B4 sets `RespawnLocation` per plot.
- **Visuals are debug-grade** — colored plot floors and emissive node
  spheres. Phase G replaces with real biome-themed assets.

### What's next

B2 — `CurrencyService` (1Hz tick) + extractor income aggregation +
`CreditsLedger` audit log + `Signal` library for shared event class.
First server→client Remote (`CreditsChanged`).

---

## B2 — Currency tick + extractor income ✅

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Branch:** `claude/review-claude-docs-LiZZS`

### What was built

- **`src/server/Modules/Economy/CurrencyService.luau`** — server-
  authoritative Credits ledger. Public API: `GetCredits`, `TrySpend`,
  `Add`, `SetMultiplier`, `RegisterExtractor`, `UnregisterExtractor`,
  `Init`. Tick loop runs at `Constants.TICK.Currency` (1Hz),
  aggregates registered-extractor income per player, multiplies by
  the per-player multiplier (default 1.0; Phase D writes 2× via
  GamePassService), and writes back to `ProfileSchema.credits`.
  Multiplier setter clamps implausible values (≤ 0 or > 10) with a
  warn rather than trusting the caller blindly.
- **`PlacementService.luau`** — affordability gate is wired:
  `if buildable.cost > 0 then CurrencyService.TrySpend(...)` runs as
  validation step 6, replacing the B1 placeholder. On TrySpend
  failure the placement returns `{ ok = false, error = "insufficient credits" }`.
  Income-bearing placements (extractors) call
  `CurrencyService.RegisterExtractor` after the part lands, so the
  next tick aggregates them.
- **`Remotes.luau`** — registered `CreditsChanged` (Server → Client).
  Clients render this for HUD display only; the server's
  `ProfileSchema.credits` is authoritative.
- **`init.server.luau`** — `CurrencyService.Init()` wired between
  `ResourceNodeSpawner.Init()` and `PlacementService.Init()` so the
  currency tick is live before the first placement Remote fires.
- **`REMOTES_REGISTRY.md`** — `CreditsChanged` row added; the
  `PlaceBuilding` row updated to reflect the wired affordability check.

### Audit (B2-scope, sandbox-side)

- `--!strict` on the new module
- StyLua + rojo build clean
- Affordability path covered by code reading: `TrySpend` deducts on
  success, returns false on insufficient funds, leaves credits
  untouched on type/data errors. PlacementService bails before
  spawning the part on `TrySpend = false`.

### Audit (B2-scope, Studio-side — pending your local run)

After F5:
1. `[CurrencyService]` doesn't appear in Output until the first tick.
   That's expected — the tick runs every 1s but only logs when an
   extractor exists.
2. **Earn Credits via the loop:**
   ```luau
   -- Server context Command Bar:
   local PlacementService = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Build.PlacementService)
   local PlotManager = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.World.PlotManager)
   local CurrencyService = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Economy.CurrencyService)
   local p = game.Players:GetPlayers()[1]
   local plot = PlotManager.GetPlot(p)
   local node = plot.nodes:GetChildren()[1]
   -- Grant starter credits so the first extractor is affordable:
   CurrencyService.Add(p, 100)
   -- Place an extractor (50 cost, 1/sec income):
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(p, "extractor", node:GetAttribute("CellX"), node:GetAttribute("CellZ")))
   -- Watch credits accrue:
   for i = 1, 5 do task.wait(1); print("credits:", CurrencyService.GetCredits(p)) end
   ```
   Expected: starting from 50 credits (100 grant − 50 extractor),
   credits increment by 1 each second.
3. **Affordability rejection:**
   ```luau
   -- With <20 credits, attempting a wall (cost 20) should fail:
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(p, "wall", 9, 9)) -- expect { ok = false, error = "insufficient credits" }
   ```
4. **Client receives CreditsChanged** — in a Player1 client context,
   ```luau
   game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("OutpostRemotes"):WaitForChild("CreditsChanged").OnClientEvent:Connect(print)
   ```
   should print every credit change.

### Tech debt / deferred

- **No CreditsLedger audit log yet.** Phase F1 anti-exploit will want
  one for "credits gained from suspicious sources" detection.
- **No batching of CreditsChanged.** At 1Hz tick rate this is fine
  (1 fire per affected player per second). If we ever lower the tick
  rate to sub-second, batch.
- **Multiplier is per-player flat.** No per-source multipliers
  (e.g., wave-defense XP bonus during a wave). Phase E may need
  per-source.
- **No persistence of the multiplier.** It's session-only (rebuilt on
  rejoin via Phase D's GamePassService.ApplyPasses on PlayerAdded).
- **Initial credits are 0.** New players can't afford anything until a
  starter grant lands (Phase B4 / FTUE) or daily login lands (C1).
  Audit recipe above uses `CurrencyService.Add` to seed.

### What's next

B3 — persistent base state. `BaseSerializer` packs the placed-
buildings dictionary into a compact form on `ProfileSchema.baseLayout`;
`BuildRestorer` re-applies on rejoin. `ProfileSchema` gets the new
`baseLayout` field (additive — `Reconcile()` handles older saves).

---

## B3 — Persistent base state ✅

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Branch:** `claude/review-claude-docs-LiZZS`

### What was built

- **`ProfileSchema.luau`** — added `baseLayout: { SerializedBuilding }`
  field with `id`, `x`, `z` per entry. Default `{}`. Additive change;
  `ProfileStore:Reconcile()` fills the empty array into older saves
  on next load — no migration needed.
- **`PlotManager.luau`** — added `WaitForPlot(player)` (yields until
  allocation or returns nil if the player left first / server full).
  Internally a per-player `BindableEvent` flushed by `allocate` and
  `release`. Lets BuildRestorer wait without racing PlayerAdded
  handler ordering.
- **`Build/BaseSerializer.luau`** — thin façade over
  `ProfileSchema.baseLayout`. Public API: `Append`, `Remove`, `Get`,
  `Clear`. Mutates the in-memory profile in place; the actual
  DataStore write happens on ProfileStore's auto-save (~5 min) or on
  `PlayerRemoving` / `BindToClose`.
- **`Build/BuildRestorer.luau`** — on plot allocation, walks the
  saved layout and re-applies each entry via
  `PlacementService.TryPlace(..., trusted = true)`. Failures log a
  warn and skip; partial restores are acceptable (Phase F1 may add
  telemetry for "buildings dropped on restore").
- **`PlacementService.luau`** — gained the `trusted: boolean?`
  parameter. When true: skip affordability deduction (already paid
  in prior session) and skip `BaseSerializer.Append` (already
  saved). When false/nil: existing fresh-placement behavior plus
  the new `BaseSerializer.Append` call after a successful place.
- **`init.server.luau`** — `BuildRestorer.Init()` wired after
  `PlacementService.Init()`. Order matters: PlacementService must be
  ready before the restorer's first replay fires.

### Persistence rhythm

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Successful placement | `BaseSerializer.Append` mutates the in-memory layout. |
| ProfileStore auto-save (~5 min) | DataStore write of all profile fields incl. baseLayout. |
| `PlayerRemoving` | DataManager.SavePlayer → ProfileStore EndSession → DataStore write. |
| `BindToClose` | Same flush path as PlayerRemoving for every active session. |
| Server crash mid-session | Up to ~5 min of placements lost (the worst-case auto-save gap). Acceptable for V1. |
| Plot allocation on rejoin | BuildRestorer walks saved layout, calls TryPlace in trusted mode for each. |

### Audit (B3-scope, sandbox-side)

- `--!strict` on the new modules
- StyLua + rojo build clean (rerun below)
- `ProfileSchema.DEFAULT_DATA.baseLayout = {}` round-trips through
  `Reconcile()` for older saves (verified by code reading)
- Trusted-mode skip paths verified by code reading: affordability
  (line ref) + persistence (line ref) both gated on `not trusted`

### Audit (B3-scope, Studio-side — pending your local run)

The full Phase B audit gate. Runs after a fresh F5 or once Server
Authority Beta is enabled per DAILY_DEV_LOOP.md:

1. **Place an extractor and a wall:**
   ```luau
   -- Server context Command Bar:
   local PlacementService = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Build.PlacementService)
   local PlotManager      = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.World.PlotManager)
   local CurrencyService  = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Economy.CurrencyService)
   local BaseSerializer   = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Build.BaseSerializer)
   local p = game.Players:GetPlayers()[1]
   local node = PlotManager.GetPlot(p).nodes:GetChildren()[1]
   local cx, cz = node:GetAttribute("CellX"), node:GetAttribute("CellZ")
   CurrencyService.Add(p, 200)
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(p, "extractor", cx, cz))
   print(PlacementService.TryPlace(p, "wall",      cx + 2, cz))
   print("layout:", #BaseSerializer.Get(p), "entries")  -- expect 2
   ```
2. **Stop play (Shift+F5).** Output should include:
   ```
   [DataManager] Saving <YourName> (sessions=2)
   [DataManager] BindToClose: flushing 1 profile(s)
   [DataManager] BindToClose: flush complete
   ```
3. **Press F5 again.** Output should include:
   ```
   [DataManager] Loaded <YourName> — session #3, credits=<remaining>, ...
   [PlotManager] Allocated PlotN to <YourName>
   [PlacementService] Restored extractor on PlotN at <cx,cz> for <YourName>
   [PlacementService] Restored wall on PlotN at <cx+2,cz> for <YourName>
   [BuildRestorer] PlotN for <YourName>: restored 2/2
   ```
4. **Visual:** the extractor and wall reappear at the same cells.
   Income tick continues (extractor still ticks the per-second income).
5. **Cross-shape failure path** (optional): manually corrupt the
   saved layout to test the warn:
   ```luau
   local data = require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Player.DataManager).GetData(p)
   table.insert(data.baseLayout, { id = "ghost_buildable", x = 0, z = 0 })
   -- leave + rejoin → expect warn:
   --   [BuildRestorer] PlotN: failed to restore ghost_buildable at (0,0) for <YourName> — unknown buildable: ghost_buildable
   --   [BuildRestorer] PlotN for <YourName>: restored 0/1
   ```

This is the **Phase B audit gate** per `10_BUILD_PROTOCOL.md`. Pass = B3
done; B4 (build mode UI) and B5 (camera transitions) ship the
client-side experience on top of the now-complete server foundation.

### Tech debt / deferred

- **No save-on-placement debounce.** Currently relies on
  ProfileStore's 5-min auto-save for mid-session persistence. If a
  server crashes between auto-saves, recent placements are lost.
  Acceptable for V1 (placements aren't real-money). Phase F1+ may
  add a debounced explicit save for "high-stakes" placements (e.g.,
  buildings that cost > N Credits).
- **No rotation field.** Buildables snap to grid in 0° rotation.
  Phase B4 build palette may add rotation; that lands as an additive
  schema change (`r: number?` defaulting to 0).
- **Restoration is replay, not snapshot.** If a buildable's stats
  change between sessions (e.g., extractor income tuning in Phase G),
  restored extractors get the new stats. This is the right behavior
  for V1 — players benefit from buffs, eat nerfs equally.
- **No restoration telemetry.** Failed-restore counts log to Output
  but don't go anywhere. Phase F1's analytics taxonomy will add a
  `build_restored_partial` event.

### What's next

B4 — client-side build mode. Third-person camera positioning,
`BuildPalette` UI (extractor / wall picker), `PlacementPreview`
(snap-to-grid ghost), HUD for Credits display via the
`CreditsChanged` Remote. First time the player places via gameplay
input rather than the Command Bar.

---

## B4 — Build mode UI ✅

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Branch:** `claude/review-claude-docs-LiZZS`

### Architectural change

- **`BuildableRegistry` moved** from `src/server/Modules/Build/` to
  `src/shared/Modules/Registry/`. Client UI needs catalog data
  (display name, cost, size, color) for the palette button labels
  and preview Part sizing. Keeping the catalog server-only would
  have meant duplicating it client-side, which drifts. The module's
  `BuildPart` function still creates server-side Parts when called
  from `PlacementService` — convention-driven (clients don't call it).

### What was built

- **`PlotManager.luau`** — gained per-plot `SpawnLocation` (Enabled =
  false; the spawn is plot-specific, set via `player.RespawnLocation`
  rather than team affinity) + `player:SetAttribute("PlotId", N)` on
  allocate (replicates to that client only) + character teleport on
  allocate if the character already exists.
- **`PlacementService.luau`** — require path for `BuildableRegistry`
  updated to the shared location. No behavioral change.
- **`src/shared/Modules/Lib/HudFormat.luau`** — `Abbreviated` (1.5K /
  2.5M) and `WithCommas` formatters. Pure functions over numbers.
- **`src/client/Modules/HUD/CreditsDisplay.luau`** — top-right
  ScreenGui readout. Listens to `Remotes.CreditsChanged` and
  refreshes via `HudFormat.Abbreviated`.
- **`src/client/Modules/HUD/HudController.luau`** — top-level
  orchestrator. B4 ships with CreditsDisplay; later phases append
  HealthDisplay, WaveTimer, Minimap.
- **`src/client/Modules/Build/BuildPalette.luau`** — bottom-center
  ScreenGui with one button per `PALETTE_ORDER` entry (extractor,
  wall). Reads catalog from shared `BuildableRegistry`. Tap toggles
  selection. Subscribes are notified via `OnSelectionChanged`.
- **`src/client/Modules/Build/PlacementPreview.luau`** — ghost Part
  follows cursor (raycast from camera through `GetMouseLocation`),
  snaps to grid via shared `GridMath.SnapToCell`, tints green/red
  based on **advisory** validation (in-plot, occupancy via Buildings
  folder scan, node availability for extractors). Server still
  authoritatively validates on `PlaceBuilding` receipt — the client
  flag only suppresses obviously-bad Remotes from going out.
- **`src/client/Modules/Build/BuildController.luau`** — wires the
  three pieces. `UserInputService.InputBegan` filters out
  GUI-consumed inputs; mouse-1 / touch over the world fires
  `Remotes.PlaceBuilding:FireServer(buildableId, cellX, cellZ)` if
  the advisory snap is valid.
- **`src/client/init.client.luau`** — `HudController.Init()` +
  `BuildController.Init()` after the existing diagnostic print.

### Audit (B4-scope, sandbox-side)

- `--!strict` on all 22 `.luau` files (was 18; added 5 client + 1
  shared HudFormat)
- `stylua --check` clean
- `rojo build` produces a `.rbxl` with the new tree
- `BuildableRegistry` now appears under `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Modules.Registry`

### Audit (B4-scope, Studio-side — pending your local run)

After F5 (with Server Authority Beta enabled):

1. **HUD appears.** Top-right shows `0 Credits`. Bottom-center shows
   two palette buttons (Extractor 50¢, Wall 20¢).
2. **Spawn location.** You spawn on your plot, not at world origin.
   Output should still include the Phase B prints (PlotManager,
   ResourceNodeSpawner, etc.).
3. **Place via UI:**
   - Server-context Command Bar:
     `require(game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Economy.CurrencyService).Add(game.Players:GetPlayers()[1], 200)`
   - HUD updates to `200 Credits`.
   - Tap **Wall**. Ghost Part follows cursor; tints green over open
     cells in your plot, red over occupied / out-of-plot.
   - Tap on a green cell. Wall appears, HUD drops to `180 Credits`.
   - Tap **Extractor**. Ghost tints green only over unclaimed nodes.
     Tap a node. Extractor appears, HUD drops further, then ticks
     up at 1/sec.
4. **Phase B audit gate (full loop):** stop play, F5 again. Walls
   and extractors are restored on your plot (Phase B3); Credits
   restored to last saved value; income tick resumes.
5. **Two-client playtest** (Test → Local Server → 2 clients):
   each client gets its own plot, sees its own HUD, places its own
   buildings. Credits don't bleed between players.

This is the **canonical Phase B audit gate** per
`10_BUILD_PROTOCOL.md` ("Two-client playtest. Both players can
perform the loop. State persists across rejoin.").

### Tech debt / deferred

- **Visuals are debug-grade.** Plain frames, no animations, no
  spring tweens on credit changes. Phase G aesthetic pass replaces.
- **Mobile UX is functional, not polished.** Palette buttons are
  large enough for thumb taps but the bottom-center placement
  collides with the default Roblox mobile control pad on some
  devices. Phase G repositions.
- **No build-mode toggle.** Build mode is always on. Phase B5
  introduces the camera + mode state machine (`Mode.Build` vs
  `Mode.Combat`); palette visibility will gate on mode then.
- **No rotation.** Phase B5 / G may add an additive `r: number?`
  field to `SerializedBuilding`.
- **No PlacementResult Remote.** Failures are silent on the wire;
  the client sees the ghost stay at the cell with no feedback.
  Phase F4 (FTUE polish) likely adds a `PlacementResult` event for
  toast notifications.
- **Advisory validation duplicates server logic.** Cell occupancy
  is checked client-side by scanning the Buildings folder; if
  validation rules diverge between client and server, players
  experience "ghost says green, server rejects" — annoying. Phase
  F4 may unify by routing through a shared `PlacementValidator`
  module that both sides require.
- **Character teleport-on-allocate** uses HRP CFrame. If the
  character isn't fully loaded yet (rare race), the teleport
  silently no-ops and the player walks from world origin.
  RespawnLocation handles subsequent respawns correctly.

### What's next

B5 — camera transition (TP↔FP). `CameraController` for smooth
TweenService blend, `ModeController` state machine
(Build / Combat / Raid), `InputRouter` for the `Constants.FEATURES.debugModeToggle`
keybind. The B5 prototype is the **go/no-go gate** per
`finalized-brainstorm.md` §3.4 risk #2 — if the swap feels bad,
Soft V1 falls back to TP-only with FP zoom for combat.

---

## B5 — Camera transition (TP↔FP) ⏳

_Pending._
